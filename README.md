# üß¨ AI-Powered Gut Microbiome Analysis for Colorectal Cancer Detection  

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide.  
Early detection can significantly improve survival rates. Recent studies show that the **gut microbiome** plays a key role in CRC development, where microbial DNA patterns can serve as biomarkers for early diagnosis.  

This project provides an **end-to-end automated pipeline** for CRC detection from **gut microbiome DNA sequences**, consisting of two main phases:

## üîÑ Project Phases  

### **Phase 1 Automated Data Processing Pipeline**  
- Traditionally, microbiome DNA preprocessing is performed with R scripts (e.g., DADA2), requiring manual steps.

- We automated this workflow entirely in **Python**, so the user only needs to provide the raw **DNA sequences (.fasta files)**.  
- The pipeline automatically:  
  - Processes and cleans the sequences  
  - Sorts the data into the required folder structure  
  - Prepares a filtered dataset ready for machine learning  

üëâ **Result:** A fully automated and scalable preprocessing step, removing manual intervention.

### **Phase 2 Machine Learning for CRC Detection**  
- Using the preprocessed data, we apply **machine learning models** to classify samples as CRC-positive or CRC-negative.  
- **Steps:**  
  1. Extract k-mers from DNA sequences  
  2. Vectorize k-mers into numerical features with `CountVectorizer`  
  3. Split dataset into train/test (80/20)  
  4. Train multiple models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN  
  5. Evaluate models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrices  

üëâ **Result:** Logistic Regression achieved the best performance, making it the most reliable model for deployment.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion  

This project demonstrates that **automated DNA preprocessing + machine learning** can provide a scalable and reliable solution for early colorectal cancer detection from microbiome data.  
By automating the preprocessing pipeline and testing multiple models, we show that **Logistic Regression** is the most effective approach, paving the way for clinical integration.
